This example takes an original program that only contains a skip
statement and variant "a" modifies the skip with an assignment to x
and variant "b" introduces an assignment to y after the skip.

The goal of this example is to test if the tool is able to handle 
a variant which extends the exit nodes of the program by introducing
a statement at the end of the program.
