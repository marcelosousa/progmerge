These benchmarks follow the same pattern:
  - There is an object of type Table that is created
  - The methods fill cells/rows of this object in different ways
  - Then return

 Without a more precise analysis to understand what the method obj.addCell does
 It is not possible to understand what the program is doing.

 A simplification of the program is to consider an array where the 
 in each index, the semantic conflict freedom property holds.
